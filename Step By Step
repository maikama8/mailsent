Set Up Public IP Address and PTR Record (for Spoofing):
Public IP Address: Ensure your server has a valid public IP.

PTR Record: A reverse DNS PTR record is required to help avoid spam filters. You need to set this record in your DNS provider settings.

You will typically request your hosting provider or domain registrar to set up a PTR record for your public IP. It should resolve to a valid domain name (e.g., mail.yourdomain.com).

You can check if the PTR record is set properly using the command:
dig -x <your_public_ip>

If the response shows a valid domain, your PTR record is correctly set.
Configure Postfix for Spoofing:
You may need to modify your Postfix configuration file to adjust for email spoofing
Add or modify the following lines based on your requirements:
myhostname = mail.yourdomain.com
mydomain = yourdomain.com
myorigin = $mydomain
mydestination = $myhostname, localhost.$mydomain, localhost
Save and exit (CTRL + X, then Y, and press Enter).
Use the install.sh script (if available):
If you have an install.sh script, you can run it to automate the installation:
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
